The Solar System

The solar system consists of the Sun and all the objects that orbit around it. There are eight planets in our solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

Mercury is the planet closest to the Sun. It is very hot during the day and very cold at night. Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system because of its thick atmosphere.

Earth is the third planet from the Sun and is the only planet known to support life. It has one moon that orbits around it. Mars is often called the Red Planet because of its reddish color.

Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system. It has a famous red spot which is actually a giant storm. Saturn is known for its beautiful rings made of ice and rock.

The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on Earth. Water evaporates from oceans and rivers, rises into the atmosphere, forms clouds, and then falls back to Earth as precipitation.

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make their own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. During photosynthesis, plants release oxygen into the air.

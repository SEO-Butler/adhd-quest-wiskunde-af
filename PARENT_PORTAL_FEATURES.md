This transforms your app from using just pre-made questions to a dynamic learning platform that adapts to your child's specific curriculum.

## üöÄ New Features Added

### 1. **Local Database System**
- **File**: `src/database/db.js`
- **What it does**: Creates a browser-based database using IndexedDB to store subjects, content, and generated questions
- **Why it's useful**: All data stays on your device - no internet required, and everything loads instantly

### 2. **Intelligent Question Generation**
- **File**: `src/logic/contentProcessor.js`
- **What it does**: Automatically analyzes uploaded text and creates different types of questions:
  - **Definition questions**: "What is photosynthesis?"
  - **Fill-in-the-blank**: "The capital of France is ______"  
  - **Multiple choice**: Generated with plausible wrong answers
  - **Numeric questions**: "What is 25% of 80?"

### 3. **Enhanced Answer Recognition**
- **File**: `src/utils/fuzzyMatching.js`
- **What it does**: Recognizes close answers even with:
  - **Misspellings**: "Paaris" ‚Üí "Paris" ‚úÖ
  - **Synonyms**: "big" = "large" ‚úÖ
  - **Abbreviations**: "USA" = "United States" ‚úÖ
  - **Extra words**: "The answer is Paris" ‚Üí "Paris" ‚úÖ
- **Provides helpful feedback**: "Close! Check your spelling" or "The answer was Paris"

### 4. **Parent Upload Interface**
- **File**: `src/components/ParentPortal.jsx`
- **What it does**: 
  - Create subjects (Math, Science, History, etc.)
  - Drag-and-drop file uploads
  - Real-time processing progress
  - Content management dashboard
- **Supported files**: Text files (.txt), PDFs (planned), Images (planned)

## üì± How to Use the New Features

### Getting Started
1. **Start the app**: `npm run dev`
2. **Access Parent Portal**: Click "Parent Portal" button on home screen
3. **Create a subject**: Click "+" to add Math, Science, History, etc.
4. **Upload content**: Select a subject, then drag/drop text files with study material

### Example Workflow
1. **Upload a history text** about Ancient Egypt
2. **Automatic processing** creates questions like:
   - "What are the large stone structures built by ancient Egyptians called?" (Answer: pyramids)
   - "The Nile River flows through ______ and several other African countries" (Answer: Egypt)
3. **Smart answers** - if your child types "piramids" it will accept it as correct and gently suggest the proper spelling

### Sample Content to Test
Create a text file with this content and upload it:

```
The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on Earth. 
Water evaporates from oceans and lakes, forming clouds. 
When clouds get heavy, precipitation falls as rain or snow. 
The average temperature for water to freeze is 32 degrees Fahrenheit.
Evaporation is when liquid water turns into water vapor.
```

This will generate questions like:
- "What is evaporation?" (Short answer)
- "At what temperature does water freeze?" (Numeric: 32¬∞F)
- "The water cycle is the continuous ______ of water on Earth" (Fill-in-blank)

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```javascript
Subjects: { id, name, description, grade, createdAt }
Content: { id, title, subjectId, contentType, content, uploadDate, status }
Questions: { id, contentId, type, prompt, answers, difficulty, hint, explanation }
```

### Question Generation Process
1. **Text Analysis**: Extract sentences, definitions, numbers, key facts
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify educational patterns (definitions, cause-effect, facts)
3. **Question Creation**: Generate multiple question types from each pattern
4. **Difficulty Calculation**: Based on word complexity and sentence length
5. **Answer Variants**: Create acceptable answer variations for flexibility

### Fuzzy Matching Algorithm
1. **Exact Match**: Direct comparison (highest priority)
2. **Edit Distance**: Allow 1-2 character differences for typos
3. **Phonetic Matching**: "ph" = "f", "ck" = "k" for sound-alike errors
4. **Synonym Recognition**: Built-in synonym database
5. **Partial Matching**: Accept answers that contain the correct term
